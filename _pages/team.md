  <div class="team-member-info">
    <h4>Dr. Fiona Kolbinger, MD</h4>
    <p>Fiona is a physician by training and joined Purdue University's Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering as a Research Assistant Professor in 2023. She holds a secondary affiliation with the Department of Visceral, Thoracic and Vascular Surgery at the University Hospital Dresden, Germany. Fiona completed her doctorate at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg, Germany in 2019 and has since conducted translational research at the intersection of surgery and data science. Her works aim to develop computational tools for personalized treatment in surgery and interventional medicine and to evaluate the clinical value of these tools in early-phase clinical trials. Fiona's publications are listed on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=bH4TiGUAAAAJ">Google Scholar</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=kolbinger+fr">Pubmed</a>.</p>
