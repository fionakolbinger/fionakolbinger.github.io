The **Translational Medical Image Computing (TMIC) Lab** is a dynamic, interdisciplinary team of researchers located at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/)'s [Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/BME) in West Lafayette, IN, USA. We work at the intersection of medicine, particularly surgery and interventional medicine, and data science, aiming to **develop clinically valuable computational tools for patient care**. Our research focuses on two main areas: Preoperative decision support and image-based intraoperative assistance. Combining technical knowledge with a clinical perspective on health and disease and an understanding of legal and regulatory requirements, our goal is to drive the clinical translation of novel technologies in the fields of surgery and interventional medicine.
